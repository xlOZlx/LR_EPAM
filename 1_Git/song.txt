House Of Glass – Alesti ft. James Deberg

The touch of our innocence is fading
(We wish, we hope, we pray)
No answers for questions we keep evading
(Go away, go away)

Before the sun we’re none
We can point the blame but it doesn’t matter
It ended before it begun
Now we run

But this shadow lingers on


 
We feel the devil’s stare
But we move on like we don’t care
‘Cause inside this house of glass
We’re throwing stones and we just
Pray for it to last

We’re standing as one but we’re divided
(We fight, we kill, we hate)
Our days pass us by but they’re spent misguided
(Now it’s too late)

We must decide on our own
If this story should end or go on

We feel the devil’s stare
But we move on like we don’t care
‘Cause inside this house of glass
We’re throwing stones and we just
Pray it lasts
We feel the devil’s stare
But we move on like we don’t care
‘Cause inside this house of glass
We throw stones and we just
Pray it lasts

(We’re throwing stones and we just
Pray for it to last)

Somewhere deep inside
Find your reasons, unify
Raise your head stay strong
It’s now or never

We feel the devil’s stare
But we move on like we don’t care
‘Cause inside this house of glass
We’re throwing stones and we just
Pray it lasts
We feel the devil’s stare
But we move on like we don’t care
‘Cause inside this house of glass
We’re throwing stones and we just
Pray for it to last
